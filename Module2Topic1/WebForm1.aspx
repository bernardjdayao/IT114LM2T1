    <h3>Question 1.</h3>
    <p>I would compare vanilla HTML as building a foundation towards ASP.NET because without the right foundation of creating a website
        it is difficult to understand concepts of ASP.NET because it involves and revolves a lot towards HTML basics and concepts
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Question 2</h3>
    <p>For me, using inline scripting and code behind has its uses but I mostly prefer separating the code behind from the front-end
        it is much easier to debug, easier to delegate functions but javascript can be used especially in debugging.
    </p>

    <h3>Question 3</h3>
    <p>A postback refers to the process where a web page is sent back to the server for processing. When a user interacts with a web page by clicking a button or performing some action that requires server-side processing, a postback occurs.</p>
